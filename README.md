# What is cloudflared-linux-arm?🧠

cloudflared-linux-arm is the ARM (32-bit) version of Cloudflared, the official command-line client made by Cloudflare. It lets your device connect securely to Cloudflare’s global network — even if your device is just a small ARM board (like a phone running Termux, a Raspberry Pi, or an ARM-based NetHunter setup).

⚙️ What Cloudflared actually does

Cloudflared provides several powerful functions:

Feature	Description

🌐 Cloudflare Tunnel	Creates a secure outbound connection from your local machine to Cloudflare — no need to open ports or use a public IP.

🔒 Encrypts Traffic	All traffic between your device and Cloudflare’s edge is encrypted (HTTPS).

🧭 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)	You can use it as a local DNS resolver that forwards queries securely through Cloudflare (1.1.1.1).

🏠 Expose Local Websites	You can run a web server on your device (e.g., localhost:8080) and access it globally via a https://something.trycloudflare.com URL.

☁️ Access Internal Networks	Enterprises use Cloudflared tunnels to connect internal/private apps to Cloudflare Zero Trust without opening firewall ports.
